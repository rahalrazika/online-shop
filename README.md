## KAWAII SHOP

This project is based on an e-commerce site Designed by Mohammed Awad, and I made it to help otakus shop and sell different products online. This is my capstone project for the HTML and CSS module in the Microverse Program. The name of this project is "Kawaii shop."

- I used HTML, CSS, and bootstrap
- It has semantic HTML tags
- This project has two pages -- the first page is the home page and the second is the search results page
